# Sandbox for Researching Federated Learning at the Edge

This is a sandbox or hodgepodge repository, containing various components of
my Master's thesis on FL and ML on real edge hardware. Most of the work in this
repository focuses on utilities to set up and run federated learning experiments
on Raspberry Pis, Coral, and Jetson Nano single-board computers (SBCs).
